Main Components:
	- PlayerList class that tracks all Players in the game.
	
	- Board class that tracks all the Spaces on the board in an array. There are 
	  3 ways to build a Board:
	  	- use the standard built-in Board with 40 spaces, Go, Jail, Free Parking,
	  	  and Go To Jail in each of their corners, and Properties in all other 
	  	  spaces,
	  	- use a similar layout but adjusted to have any number of spaces,
	  	- or create a Board based on a Space array parameter.
	  	
	- Player class that represents a player, including balance, location,
	  and owned properties information. 
	  	- moveLocation(): moves the Player a number of steps, collects $200 if it passes Go,
	      and activates the Space it lands on's actionOnPlayer() method. 
	      
	- Space interface that represents a single square on the Board. Implemented by:
		- Property class that represents each purchasable Space.
			- actionOnPlayer(): Performs the following procedures:
				1) If not owned, offer up for purchase.
				2) Else if visitor is not the owner and not on mortgage, charge rent.
				3) If owned by visitor or mortgaged, do nothing.
			- A client can change the Property's owner with the buying Player's 
		     purchaseUnownedProperty() method.
		     
		- GoToJail class that sends a Player to the Jail. A GoToJail must always
		  be constructed with the location of its corresponding Jail as a parameter.
			- actionOnPlayer(): sends the landing Player to Jail
			
		- NoEventSpace class that does nothing when a Player lands on it. There are
		  3 types of this class, which only differ in their toString() representation.
			- Go
			- Jail, which is implemented as a Just Visiting Space that does nothing.
			  It is the Player class's responsibility to perform the get out of jail
			  operations. 
			- Free Parking

Notes:
	- The specification was ambiguous as to what is done when a Player gets out of 
	  Jail. I interpreted it as the Player not being able to re-roll the dice or 
	  move the same turn that they get out of Jail. However, the specification was 
	  clear in stating that there is no 3 turns in Jail rule. The very next turn a Player 
	  is sent there, they MUST be freed.
	- Ownership of properties is tracked by both the Property itself and by the Players.
